    <p> My name is Bailee Strait. I'm 21 years old from Killen, Alabama. I'm currently
        a Junior at UNA, majoring in Information Technology with a
    concentration in HCI/UX Design. I'm currently a member of UNA's Student Government Association as a Senator
and Student Alumni Association as an Ambassador for their Membership Committee.</p>
<p> I cherish my family and my pets. I also enjoy developing my skills in my hobbies like digital art, and crocheting. </p>
